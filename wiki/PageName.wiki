WebLearning 
= Introduction =

WebLearning is an attempt to simplify the creation of simple web application. As the name indicates WebLearning is a project to learn the simple web application using Java/J2EE technologies.


= Details =

To run the project just checkout the project and import the project into an IDE(I prefer Eclipse though). Then right click on the project and give Run As--> Run on server(Hopefully you have installed any web server like Tomcat, I am using tomcat 7).

Wait wait! We have to create a simple database isn't it?

Yes Sir. So download and install MySQL Database and create a database called  "web_learning".

That's it now you will be able to run and see the registration page.:)
